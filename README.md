# Resume Classification using NLP

## Overview
A machine learning project to classify resumes based on their content (e.g., Data Scientist, Web Developer, HR).

## Technologies
- Python
- NLP (NLTK / SpaCy)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `Resume_Classifier.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with model training & evaluation
- `sample_resumes/` — Folder with sample resumes (to be added)
- `model.pkl` — Trained model (to be added)

## Steps
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, stemming)
2. TF-IDF vectorization
3. Classification using Random Forest
4. Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix

## Note
This is a placeholder repository. Code and data will be added soon.
